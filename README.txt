                     IMAGE TO ASCII PROJECT README - BY JACKSON ADAMS

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To set this up, you either need to put the image in the same folder as the python
script, name it "image", and make sure it is a .jpg file.

To use through the terminal, input the following commands in your terminal:
 - cd [insert enclosing folder's file path]  // option-right-click on file in finder
 - /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
 - brew install python
 - pip3 install Pillow


Now to launch the file, enter: 
 - cd [insert enclosing folder's file path]
 - python3 [insert script's file path]

My command is: cd /Users/jacksonadams1/VSCode/ImageToAscii
               python3 imagetoascii.py
	       (You can replace for convenience)

Make sure to keep your resolution from getting too high. A good start is around 500,
and crashes often occur at around 1500.

For the .txt file, you may have to zoom out or shrink your text by quite a bit to see
the image, as text wrapping does occur.

Drag files to another folder for them to save. Otherwise the script rewrites them.

Thanks for using! Enjoy!						   10/10/2024
